# Tic-Tac-Toe Using C

## Introduction 
As one of my first projects, I have created a simple program that allows you to go against an AI-generated player within the game "Tic-Tac-Toe". The game demonstrates the use of the Minimax algorithm for the AI to move for each set, while also demonstrating the use of game logic in C programming. I was able to create this program through my knowledge of arrays, structures, and algorithms, printf function, scanf function, for loop, while loop, and user-defined functions.

## Installation
### Prerequisites:
- Any compatible C compiler (mainly GCC)

## How to play?

The user will be prompted to make a choice/move by entering a number corresponding to each box from 1-9. After, the AI will make its move against you. The game continues until either player wins or loses or a tie.
